Modules: grouping of application pieces, grouping of components, services and various other angular app pieces.
In Angular, a module is a mechanism to group components, directives, pipes and services that are related, 
in such a way that can be combined with other modules to create an application. 
An Angular application can be thought of as a puzzle where each piece (or each module) is needed to be able
 to see the full picture.
 export class AppModule{}
 @NgModule : is a decorater contains all the information needed to group the apllication together. 
 declaration: list all teh componenets of the apllication
 imports : modules : browser Module is default
 providers : [] : servuces
 bootsrrap : lists which is teh main root componenet . usually app componenet is the main
 
 Service : A place to keep application state and logic
 
 angular provides differentr containters in orfder to store state and logic
 
 1.CONTAINER
 * display logic
* display state
belongs to single view
2.SERVICS 
* application state and logic
if theoretically  belong to multiple views

A services usually consisits of @Injectable and export class FlopServiec
@Injectable : decorator : is dealinmg with DI. This allows angular to know where services can be used.
it has one key called providedIn with string value root
class  : will have data and functionality (method). coomon ones talk to server
make http calls to server to retrieve data
servives are simple building blocks 

HOW TO INJECT SERVICES : 
1. in AppComponent  add constructor(public flopservice :FlopServiec)  
 import statement automatically comes at the top for the FlopServiec
 eg onClick(){
 this.flopservice.acessvaroiusmethods/functionality
 
 this allows the application to be broken into various pieces 
 
 SERVICES
 There are a lot of flags that can be used when creating services, but the --skipTests flag is probably the most common. 
 It's also good to memorize the shorthand ng g s SERVICE_NAME for generating services with minimal keystrokes.
 
 COMPONENTS
 import
 @componenet : decorater
   * selectorset to app-vote 
   *tempelate : points to html files 
   * styleURls : apply to the components
 Export class VoteComponent
 ngOnInIt() is initialized in teh constructor . So if we want anything to be displayed on the page 
 when it first loads then we pot in constructor in onInIt(). 
In app.module.ts
we have import of vote and cart componenets
we have @NgModule declaration :[AppComponent 
								VoteComponent,
								Cart Component]  
Components onve created are added to the declarations of the app.component.module 
So now the angular knows that these components exist and when it encounters in html it know how to load, initialize and render them.

QUESTION WHAT IS THE FLAG FOR NOT INSTALLING THE NODE MODULES IN NEW APP 
ANSWER : --skipInstall
								
   we learn some of the flags we can use when creating components. Some good ones to know are:
   
--inlineStyle
--inlineTemplate
--skipTests

CHILD COMPONENET
in html page 
* h1
* div
So , componenets are used to break dowwn the application into more managable pieces

PATRENT TO CHILD COMMUNICATION
'movie' is in the child component which takes care of the styling and the data is in the app.componenet.ts
    we use @Input() movie in the child component(movie-tile) which is that it takes the data from the parent component
    in the parent component html(app) we in the child component selector attribute we use the movie keyword in square bracket
     and it gets assigned the instance of the data which is to be sent.
    in teh parent temeplate we tell the data which is to be sent to the child. This is done by binding syntax(property binding
    to child component). 
    2 step process
    * child is prepaerd to recieve the data using @Input decorator and a property(movie).
    The property is then used in the html temeplate of child component to bind to the properties to display data
    * parent to send the data to the child we bind to that property
